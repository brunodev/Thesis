# Problem

Exploiting known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations and weaknesses in native protocols to compromise Windows Active Directory Domains with a focus on traceability and ease of use.




During my internship did pentests..
Initial foothold -> same stuff
Gaining domain credentials -> same stuff, dumping
Problems with current state -> Slow. Running tools on customers network.
AV Detection -> we want to avoid
Road to domain admin -> When, what, in what order

Can this be automated -> it can be made easier
