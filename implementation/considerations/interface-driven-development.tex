\subsubsection{\glsentryfull{idd}}
The whole project is developed with the \gls{idd} technique\cite{url:considerations:interface-drive-development-1}\cite{url:considerations:interface-drive-development-2} in mind. When using interfaces properly in any object oriented language you, at least when you do it correct, you gain a few advantages such as
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Easy and powerful unit-testing
    \item Better architecture, as one has to design the interfaces and correlations beforehand which requires more analysis
    \item Maintainable code. All code can essentially be changed or replaced as long as it still implements the same interface
\end{enumerate}
