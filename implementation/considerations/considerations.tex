\subsection{Considerations}
\label{sec:considerations}
When developing software of this complexity a solid foundation is important to be able to continue development on it. Even though the most optimal techniques and attack vectors have been chosen, it is very plausible that other non-considered techniques should be implemented later on. This requires the foundation to be able to support further development on the project, and the project should therefore strive to be extendable. This is also the reason for the separation of the worker process and the graphical interface in the form of the web app. Separating these two will make it easier to develop both simultaneously as long as they share the same interface.
