\subsubsection{ASP.NET Core}
Almost all programming languages have their own web framework and they mostly work the same. There are definitely pros and cons to all frameworks, but the author has a large background in C\# and the .NET framework, and therefore ASP.NET Core was the obvious choice. The advantage of ASP.NET Core is that it is cross platform\cite{url:implementation:aspnet-core} and based on C\#, which in the authors opinion, is a very good option for a modern and safe programming language.\\
Furthermore, when penetration testing Windows networks it makes sense to use a programming language and framework developed by the same company.
