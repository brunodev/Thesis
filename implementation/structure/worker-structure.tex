\subsubsection{\mintinline{csharp}{Worker}}
The primary task of the \mintinline{csharp}{Worker} is to register and handle modules in their lifetime. Two types of module exists right now, but the implementation is structured such that new ones can be added easily.

\paragraph{\mintinline{csharp}{IPersistentModule}} is a module that is meant to run all the time in its own thread. The module lifetime is handled by the \mintinline{csharp}{Worker}, and therefore requires to implement both \mintinline{csharp}{Start} and \mintinline{csharp}{Stop} methods in order to be controlled.
\\\\
Persistent modules are then currently split in two in the form of \textbf{spoofers} and \textbf{Servers (or services)}. As the logic for most \textbf{spoofers} are the same, they are all controlled by \mintinline{csharp}{SpooferCore} and inherits from the base class \mintinline{csharp}{BaserSpoofer} to keep redundant code at a minimum. The logic for \textbf{services} vary much though, and therefore they do not inherit from a base class.

\paragraph{\mintinline{csharp}{LLMNRSpoofer} and \mintinline{csharp}{NBNSSpoofer}} is the implementation of the \gls{llmnr} and \gls{nbns} spoofers as analyzed in section \ref{sec:spoofing} (\nameref{sec:spoofing})

\paragraph{\mintinline{csharp}{HTTPServer} and \mintinline{csharp}{SMBServer}} is the implementation of the \gls{http} and \gls{smb} servers/services as analyzed in section \ref{sec:credential-acquiring} (\nameref{sec:credential-acquiring})

\paragraph{\mintinline{csharp}{IActionModule}} is a module that is meant to run on demand, which means that it only implements a \mintinline{csharp}{Run} method from the \mintinline{csharp}{IActionModule} interface. An example of such a module is the \mintinline{csharp}{LsassDumpTool} which is the attack explained in section \ref{sec:remote-access}
