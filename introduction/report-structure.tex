\subsection{Report structure}
This report is split into three main focus areas to first give the reader an in-depth knowledge of the theory and the attack chain, and thereafter show how such the attack chain was implemented and in the end the whole project is discussed.

\paragraph{Initial foothold and attack methods} is structured to build on the previous step of the attack chain. In the beginning of every section, a choice is made as to what the next step in attack chain is, and then the attack is explained in depth by analyzing the relevant protocols, tools and techniques.

\paragraph{Implementation} uses all of the knowledge gained in the previous sections to implement an application that uses the explained attack chain to compromise a Windows \gls{ad}. This section will show the structure of the developed program and detail the frameworks, libraries and methods used to implement it.

\paragraph{Discussion} is where the final app is discussed and evaluated in comparison to the theory and the attack chain. This section will also contain details of future improvements, whats missing from the implementation and other general reflections.
